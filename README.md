### Dockerized Testing of the Recommendation Storage Service

This repo contains the Dockerfile and Postman JSON tests (and environment variables) for testing the Recommendation Storage Service and API.

Assuming the recommendation storage will be accessible at `https://reco-storage:8080/v1`, the tests will run and evaluate (ideally to verify) if the service is returning correct data and error messages.
